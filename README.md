# Resource Explorer

This is a small evaluation project that helps us determine the programming skills and style of applicants and also serves as an example of what might await you at our company.

## Requirements
In order to get the source files, you'll need [Git](https://git.io/). Other then that, basically any _not-too-old_ version of [Node](https://nodejs.org) and a _not-too-old_ web browser should be enough.

## Installation
First get the source files by running
```bash
$ git clone https://git.geogebra.org/evaluation/resource-explorer
$ cd resource-explorer
```
then install the dependencies by
```bash
$ npm i
```

The development server can be started by running
```bash
$ npm start
```

## Do the work
There are two main tasks to do in this evaluation:
1. a review of an existing feature
2. the implementation of a new one

For the first task have a look at the already existing resource list (which should open automatically after starting the
server) and to the code behind it as well. Try to find the problems in the current implementation and note them as part
of a review message with ideas for the possible fixes (alternatively you can also just fix it in the code right away).

For the second task please implement a "details page" that shows information about a specific resource. This page should
be available at the `/details/:id` route and should be based on the [`GET /materials/{id}` method](https://groot.geogebra.org:555/?url=https://api.geogebra.org/v1.0/openapi#/materials/Materials%5CController%5CMaterialController%3A%3Aget)
of the API. On this page the same information should be visible as in the resource list, along with all the contributors, the
language, the description and all tags (which includes categories, tags and topics).

As a little help, the project is using the following technologies (keep their standards in mind):
* [React](https://reactjs.org)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web)
* [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/)

These tasks are not only to proof that you can write code that works but rather to see **how** you do it: 
* how is your code organized
* if you use patterns properly
* if you take care of readability/maintainability
* etc.

## Commit your work
In order to commit your work, please create a patch and send the patch file by email to
the following address: jobs@geogebra.org

A patch file can be generated by Git:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Solution"
[master 22b65a9] Solution
 ...
$ git format-patch master^
0001-Solution.patch
```

These commands do the following:

1. `git add` adds all file changes to the git index.
2. `git commit` saves the changes to the local repository.
3. `git format-patch` creates a patch file for the latest commit (don't forget the `^` 
   in the end!).

In this example the file `0001-Solution.patch` would be the file to attach to your
email.
