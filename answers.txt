Task 1:

1. Folder structure: 
   * material-card.js was placed in root directory. Implemented
   * Extracted Header.js into separate component for better component layout.
2. Naming scheme was not consistent. 
   * Converted component/page name to follow PascalCase.
3. "on-intersect" as library: This project's usability depends heavily on infinite-scroll behaviour, for which we are using "on-intersect". 
Although working well in this project, "on-intersect" is not a very well maintained library (last published 5 years ago on npmjs.com) with limited community/users (weekly downloads - 14).
Hence, better to find an alternative for this, or implement it from scratch using native browser APIs. 
4. Improved general UI.
